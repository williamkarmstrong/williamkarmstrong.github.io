<h3>About</h3>
<p>I built the website to practice using HTML and CSS. The website is responsive to different screen sizes and links to my socials in the footer</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Firstly I sketched some rough wireframes to get an idea of how I wanted the site to look and then used Canva to get a better picture of how I wanted everything to be positioned</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>I tested the website on my laptop and my phone ensuring that it worked for Chrome and Safari.</p>
